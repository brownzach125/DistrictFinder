Dear $salutation,

Thank you for your interest in Citizens' Climate Lobby! I'm always excited to meet new people passionate about making a difference and pursuing non-partisan climate change solutions!

I'm the Membership Coordinator for the Houston Metro Area. I will serve as your initial point of contact; I can answer any questions you may have about CCL, our ongoing work, or ways you can help.

I would truly appreciate the opportunity to speak with you to talk more about CCL and your interests. Would you be available to talk over the phone on $day at $time pm? Please feel free to suggest a different time, I'm happy to accommodate your schedule.

In the meantime, here are some links to help you get plugged into CCL or just answer some preliminary questions you have:

For a great overview of CCL and an interactive Q&A, join us for a Wednesday Night Intro Call (https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-weekly-intro-call/).

To get connected to CCL, my recommendation is our CCL Community (https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/). It has everything you could want; from more information and trainings, to forums and groups!

To really arm yourself with knowledge, you should check out the Climate Advocate (https://citizensclimatelobby.org/new-member/#climateadvocatetraining).

For updates on what CCL chapters in your area are up to, check out our regional Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/CCL3rdCoast).


Thanks again, and welcome to CCL!

Warmly,
